# sqli101
sqli101 is a serie of four box introducing SQL injections.

It will cover four injections:
* Bypassing login/password to login as any user
* Retrieving any password in a known table
* Dumping any data when seeing the result of the request
* Dumping any data in a blind SQL injection

To confirm the exploitation of those injections, four flags are to be found, they are in the format: `flag{...}`.

## Not covered
This box does not explain the underlying technologies that are used. (e.g. docker, clickhouse, nodejs)  
Plenty of ressources of high quality are available through your favorite search engine.
