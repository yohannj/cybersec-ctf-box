# ReaCH me
reaCH me is a box about database vulnerabilities, in this case about ClickHouse.

To confirm the exploitation of the vulnerability, a flag can be found in the root folder of the database. It is in the format: `flag{...}`.

## Storytelling
I got this ClickHouse server running without issues for years so I never thought about updating it.
Recently someone stole sensitive data I had stored there. Can you help me find how the intruder did it?

## Playing the box
You can access the code inside the `dist` folder.
To start the challenge, go to `challenge` and run `docker-compose up -d`.
