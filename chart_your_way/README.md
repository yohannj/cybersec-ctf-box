# chart_your_way
chart_your_way is a box introducing a vulnerability in a web app.

To confirm the exploitation of the vulnerability, a flag can be found in the root folder of the web server. It is in the format: `flag{...}`.

# Material
## Code
This repository can be seen as a white box, do not hesitate to check the code.
Obviously as this is self-hosted, the flags can be read from the code, but the real challenge is to start the services using `docker-compose up -d` and try to find them by interacting with the services.
