# Chart your way
chart_your_way is a box introducing a vulnerability in a web app.

To confirm the exploitation of the vulnerability, a flag can be found in the root folder of the web server. It is in the format: `flag{...}`.

## Storytelling
I recently discovered chart.js and made a POC out of it.
While presenting that POC to the R&D, my web server got hacked!

Now my colleagues don't want to hear about chart.js anymore. Can you tell me what I did wrong?
I'm convinced it has nothing to do with chart.js!

## Playing the box
You can access the code inside the `dist` folder.
To start the challenge, go to `challenge` and run `docker-compose up -d`.
