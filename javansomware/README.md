# Javansomware
javansomware is a box about reversing a ransomware.

To confirm the successful reversing, a flag can be decoded. It is in the format: `flag{...}`.

## Storytelling
Looks like the script kiddie is trying to grow on his own.
He found another vulnerability in our infrastructure and was able to run a ransomware of a new kind.

Based on network analysis we retrieved his payload, a jar file. Can you investigate it and retrieve the content of my most important file?

## Playing the box
You can access the ransom jar file and an encoded file inside the `dist` folder.
You must decode the file.
