# Flink my secrets
Flink my secrets is a box about application vulnerabilities, in this case about Flink.

To confirm the exploitation of the vulnerability, a flag can be found in the environment variable `FLAG`. It is in the format: `flag{...}`.

## Storytelling
I got this docker-compose from Flink's official documentation and it is now up and running.
With this minimal setup, this is certainly a good sandbox.

## Playing the box
You can access the code inside the `dist` folder.  
To start the challenge, go to `challenge` and run `docker-compose up -d`.
