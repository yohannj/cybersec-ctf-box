# Ranxorware
ranxorware is a box about reversing a ransomware.

To confirm the successful reversing, a flag can be decoded. It is in the format: `flag{...}`.

## Storytelling
A script kiddie recently accessed my NAS and made of mess of my files.  
He left his ransom script on the NAS though. Can you retrieve the content of my most important file?

## Playing the box
You can access the ransom script and an encoded file inside the `dist` folder.  
You must decode the file.
